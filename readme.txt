A starter theme called caleighm, built using underscores.

== Description ==

I built this WP theme based on Underscores.me as the starting point, and I referred to Lynda.com's "Build a WordPress Theme from Scratch Using Underscores" to help make this. This is definitely still a work-in-progress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this theme support any plugins? =

caleighm includes support for Infinite Scroll in Jetpack.
